# WeatherBot
WeatherBot is a chatBot I create using ChatBase for my AI/ML learning course for my master degree. WeatherBot can provide you with the current weather forecast for your state and city. If you prompt the agent for example "What is today's forecast for Dayton, Ohio?" You can also prompt WeatherBot with questions like "what should I wear?" link to WeatherBot
